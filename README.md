#quoraquestions
This is just a little project i put together. 
Everytime someone asks a "how do you do..."
or "can you write xxx program?" in the C section
on quora, i write out the function and it to this program
this is essentially a program that will eventually 
encompass many source files and functions that
will compile, run, go through all of the functions
but the program wont actually do anything useful (story of my life)
maybe i should have named it story of my life...
